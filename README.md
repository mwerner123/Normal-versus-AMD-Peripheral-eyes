# Normal-versus-AMD-eyes and implication crispr knockout gene in AMD
This is an RNA-Seq Analysis to evaluate the differential expression of normal versus AMD eyes in retina and retinal pigment epithelium/choroid/sclera tissue
It is also an RNA-Seq analysis between crispr cas9 knockout gene of interest and AMD 
The folder entitled Normal-AMD-PR includes the raw count files for retina from HTseq count output for AMD and Normal eye samples.  Also included are the results spreadsheet files from DESEq2 differential analysis for all genes as well as for significant genes only 
The folder entitled PR-Cuffdiff includes the output Cuffdiff spreadsheet files for retina for all genes as well as significant genes only. 
The folder entitled Normal-AMD-PRCS includes the raw count files from RCS tissue from HTseq count output for AMD and Normal eye samples.  Also included are the results spreadsheet files from DESEq2 differential analysis for all genes as well as for significant genes only 
The folder entitled PRCS-Cuffdiff are includes the output Cuffdiff spreadsheet files from RCS tissue for all genes as well as significant genes only. 
The folder entitled QueryGene includes the raw count files from knockout gene of interest from HTseq count output for wild and mutant samples.  Also included are the results spreadsheet files from DESEq2 differential analysis for all genes as well as for significant genes only 
The folder entitled QueryGene-cuffdiff includes the output Cuffdiff spreadsheet files for crispr knockout for all genes as well as significant genes only. 
The project Rmd file is included.
